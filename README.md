## Project: Note-Taking Application
This web application allows the user to keep track of notes by submitting form contents that will be displayed on a list. Notes can be sorted by tags and colours defined by the user and can be rearranged or deleted. Sorting notes will be based on multiple factors such as titles, dates, tags, or note contents. Additional features may include the ability to upload images as notes, or to save the note contents as a downloadable file. Notes that are created by this application are saved on the local storage and can be accessed by the user again in their next session on the app.

## Functional Requirements
* A “plus” button is shown on the top of the screen If clicked, the user is provided with the option to create a new note
*Each note has a delete button, which will remove it from the list
* A “delete all” button removes all user created notes
* There is a sort button which rearranges all notes based on their contents, date of creation, and titles
* Users can tag notes with coloured labels
* Users can change design settings (text size, font, colour etc.) maybe allow the user to set some default settings
* Allow the user to format the content of a note (ex. Bullet points, highlighting). There will be a toolbar on the screen that offers the users these options, when the user selects an option the formatting option chosen will be applied  to all following text until the user deselects  
* When the user leaves the web application and comes back, all the notes are where they were left off from the last session
* To add an image, there will be an add image option. When the name of an image file or the link to an image is typed. The app will display the photo in the note
* On the page to view all notes, a search bar will be added to quickly search for notes
