## Project: Note-Taking Application
This web application allows the user to keep track of notes by submitting form contents that will be displayed on a list. Notes can be sorted by tags and colours defined by the user and can be rearranged or deleted. Sorting notes will be based on multiple factors such as titles, dates, tags, or note contents. Additional features may include the ability to upload images as notes, or to save the note contents as a downloadable file. Notes that are created by this application are saved on the local storage and can be accessed by the user again in their next session on the app.
